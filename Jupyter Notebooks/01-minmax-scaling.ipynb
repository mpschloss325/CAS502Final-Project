    "## Composite Scores: \n",
    "**Uses:** A key feature of this project is the ability to **compare respondents** by generating **similarity scores** based on survey data. Some variables—like **age or income**—can be directly compared because they exist on a measurable scale. Others, such as **gender, ethnicity, household size, and education level**, can still be used for comparison but require more **contextual interpretation** rather than numerical scaling.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate comparisons, the survey includes **composite scores**, which aggregate responses from multiple related questions into a single metric. These scores help **identify patterns** across respondents, but they also have **limitations**—they summarize complex behaviors and attitudes into a number, which may not capture the full **nuance of individual responses**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:** While composite scores allow for broad **comparisons across the population**, they should be used with **an understanding of their constraints** They are designed to be reductive, rahter than expansive in nature, but the individual questions that contribute to these scales can still provide deeper insights into specific trends.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges:** Some composite scores in the dataset **use different numerical ranges** (e.g., **0–36, 1–5, 3–21**). Without standardization, **direct comparisons are not meaningful**—a score of **10 in one category** might not represent the same level of agreement as **10 in another category**. Before meaningful comparisons can be made, we need to standardize the scores, by re-scaling them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps** Min-Max scaling will transform all columns holding composite data into a **range from 0 to 1**. This ensures that **all composite scores** contribute equally to **similarity calculations**, making comparisons between respondents **more interpretable and reliable**."
